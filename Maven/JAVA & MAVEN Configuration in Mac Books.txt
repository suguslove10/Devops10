To configure JAVA_HOME and PATH for Java, and MAVEN_HOME and PATH for Maven on an Apple laptop as system environment variables, follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine Installation Paths
Java Installation Path:
Open a Terminal and run:

/usr/libexec/java_home -V
This will list the installed Java versions along with their paths.

Maven Installation Path:
If Maven is installed via Homebrew, its path is usually /usr/local/Cellar/maven/<version>/libexec. If you installed it manually, navigate to the directory where Maven is installed.

Step 2: Open the Profile File
Open your terminal and edit the profile file. The profile file can be one of the following depending on the shell you are using (bash, zsh, etc.):

For bash (default for older macOS versions):

nano ~/.bash_profile
For zsh (default for newer macOS versions, starting from macOS Catalina):

nano ~/.zshrc
Step 3: Set JAVA_HOME and PATH
Add the following lines to set JAVA_HOME and update the PATH for Java:

export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v <java_version>)
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
Replace <java_version> with the version you want to use (e.g., 11 or 16). To set a specific Java version, use the exact path obtained in Step 1.

Add the following lines to set MAVEN_HOME and update the PATH for Maven:

export MAVEN_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/maven/<version>/libexec
export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
Replace <version> with the Maven version you have installed.

Step 4: Save and Apply Changes
Save the changes in nano editor by pressing CTRL + O, then Enter to confirm. Exit the editor by pressing CTRL + X.

Apply the changes by running the following command:

For bash:

source ~/.bash_profile
For zsh:

source ~/.zshrc
Step 5: Verify the Configuration
To verify that JAVA_HOME is set correctly, run:

echo $JAVA_HOME
This should print the Java installation path.

To verify that MAVEN_HOME is set correctly, run:

echo $MAVEN_HOME
This should print the Maven installation path.

To check if java and mvn are correctly added to PATH, run:

java -version
mvn -version
If everything is set up correctly, these commands should display the respective versions of Java and Maven.

Example Configuration for zsh:
Here is an example of what your ~/.zshrc file might look like after making the changes:


export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

export MAVEN_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.5/libexec
export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
Replace 11 with your desired Java version and 3.8.5 with your installed Maven version.

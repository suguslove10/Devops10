1. Code Commit
2. Code Pipeline
3. Project 1
4. Code Build

Code Commit
----------------------------
1. Create a repo in aws cloud
2. Create an IAM User and attach AWSCodeCommitPowerUser permissions
3. Generate HTTPS Credentials for the user created in step 2
4. Clone the repo using VS Code Editor
5. Create a file and commit the changes and push the file to code commit repo
6. Verify the changes in the code commit repo.

Code Pipeline
-----------------------------------
=> All the code suite services are serverless.
=> Code Pipeline is similar to Jenkins
=> Jenkins is a CI & CD Tool/Service
=> By using CP, we are going to automate the application deployment

Code --- CC Repo --- CP Service --- Deploy the code --- EC2 Instance

=> Pipeline is the step by step execution of a job/task

=> Office (10.00 AM) ---- 6.00 AM --- 8.00 AM --- 8.10 AM --- 9.30 AM --- 9.50 AM --- 10.00 AM --- Start working

Ex: Access my App
		--- Code --- CC Repo/S3 Bucket/GitHub Repo --- Create 2 buckets (source bucket, prod bucket) --- Enable the SWS --- Upload the code --- Create a pipeline with 2 steps (1st step-get the code from repo, 2nd step-deploy the code)

Steps
-------------
1. Create 2 buckets
	Bucket1: source-bucket, enable versioning
	Bucket2: prod-bucket, Enable ACLs, 'Uncheck' the block all public access option, Enable Static Website Hosting
2. Create a bucket policy (optional)
3. Create a pipeline
4. Upload the files in the bucket
5. Access the app using SWH URL

Project 1
--------------------
Code Pipeline + Code Deploy

Repo URL: https://github.com/KastroVKiran/code-deploy-code-pipeline-project.git

1st case ---- Code Commit Repo
2nd case ---- S3 Bucket --- App deployment was made in s3 bucket using SWH concept
3rd case ---- GitHub Repo --- App deployment will be made in ec2 instance

Code deploy and code build are almost same.
Code deploy is used to deploy the code into the ec2 instances
Code deploy is similar to Jenkins

Files for various DevOps Services
-----------------------------------------------
1. Jenkins --- Jenkinsfile
2. Docker --- Dockerfile
3. Ansible --- .yml files
4. Terraform --- .tf files

=> In code deploy we will write a configuration file which is known as 'appspec.yml' file

=> YML is a scripting language

=> YAML or YML ----> Yet Another Markup Language

Steps
----------
1. Repo URL: https://github.com/KastroVKiran/code-deploy-code-pipeline-project.git
2. Code Deploy
	2.1 IAM User
	2.2 Create a role
3. Launch 1 ubuntu VM
4. Pipeline

Role Name:  project1_role
Role Name (only for code deploy): code-deploy-role

1. Code in repo
2. Create a App in Code Deploy service
3. Create a deployment group
	3.1. IAM Role
	3.2. Launch Ubuntu VM with userdata. And, attach the IAM role created in 3.1 step 
	3.3. Create one more role only for code deploy
	3.4. Now create the deployment group and attach the role created in step 3.3.
4. Create pipeline
5. Access the application using Public IP of instance

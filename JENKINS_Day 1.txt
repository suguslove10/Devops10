1. Introduction to CI & CD
-----------------------------------
CI - Continuous Integration
CD - Continuous Delivery
CD - Continuous Deployment 

CI is a combination (Continuous Build) CB and (Continuous Testing) CT
CI = CB + CT

Building the code means packaging the code as a jar/war files
v1 - t1
v2 - t2
v3 - t3

CI? - The process of building the code and testing the code is known as Continuous Integration

CD? - Deploying the code manually to the production environment is known as Continuous Delivery

CD? - Deploying the code automatically to the production environment is known as Continuous Deployment

Pre-CI ----> Manual Deployment
Post-CI -----> Automated Deployment

2. Introduction to Jenkins
--------------------------------
It is a free and open source s/w
It is an automation tool for CI&CD purposes
Jenkins is developed by using JPL
It is a part of Hudson Project
Before the change the name to Jenkins, we used to call Jenkins as Hudson
Using Jenkins, we can implement CI& CD process/pipelines
Jenkins was invented by Kosukha Kawaguchi in 2004, July in Sun Micro Systems
Currently Jenkins is owned by Oracle and it made FREE
Jenkins is not a tool. It is service.
Jenkins will run on port number 8080

EC2 Instance --- Tomcat (8080), Jenkins (8080)

Build and Deployment Process
--------------------------------------
1. Take the latest code from the repo
2. Compile the code
3. Execute the code (JUnit Testing)
4. Perform the code review
5. Package of code (war files)
6. Deploy the war file into the servers

All the above steps we are going to automate using Jenkins

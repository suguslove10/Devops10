TOMCAT

Developers --- Writes the source code --- Testing the code --- DevOps Engineers --- Take the code from repo --- Create the infrastructure --- Deploy the code into the servers/VMs

S3 - Static Website Hosting (index.html)
EC2 - index.html

Deploying the application is the ultimate aim of any devops engineers.

Types of deploying an application
----------------------------------------------
2 ways;
1. Manual deployment
2. Automated deployment

Manual Deployment --- Deploying the code manually into the servers is known as Manual Deployment

90% of the real-time projects are developed by using JPL.
If you want to deploy the java code into the servers, we will use different types of servers;
TOMCAT, JBOSS, NGINX....

Manual Deployment
---------------------------------
Java web applications will be deployed in the form of war files
Java standalone applications will be deployed in the form of jar files

Webserver which is used for manual and also automated deployment is TOMCAT (Java based code)

Process
-------------------
AWS --- EC2 --- Linux based instance --- Install tomcat, install java --- Deploy the war file --- Access the web app using Public IP of instance

Apache is the name of the organization. Tomcat is the name of the server
Apache Tomcat
Tomcat is an open-source s/w and it is available for FREE of cost
Tomcat server will run on port number 8080
You can always change the port number of tomcat


1. How to download the tomcat server
2. Understand tomcat folder structure
3. Installation of tomcat webserver into the Linux based EC2 Instance
4. Maven Web Application --- war file --- deployment into the tomcat server in a manual way

Downloading the tomcat server into the local system
---------------------------------------------------------------------
https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi 
Local system --- click on zip file and extract the zip file to see the tomcat folder structrure

Folder structure of tomcat server
--------------------------------------------
1) BIN - Binaries - It consists of the files which are related to the start and stop of tomcat server
	'.bat' files - are used for windows OS --- If you want to start the tomcat sever: startup.bat, If you want to stop the tomcat sever: shutdown.bat
	'.sh' files - are used for Linux OS --- If you want to start the tomcat sever: startup.sh, If you want to stop the tomcat sever: shutdown.sh

2) LIB - Libraries - Library folder consists of libraries - jar files

3) CONF - Configuration - It contains configurations files
	server.xml ----> To configure the tomcat port number
	tomcat-users.xml ----> To configure the user details
	context.xml

4) LOGS - It contains the server logs i.e execution details

5) TEMP - Temporary - It contains temporary data

6) WEBAPPS - In this folder we will keep the application war files. It is also called as 'Deployment' folder

Working with Tomcat in the linux ec2 instance
-----------------------------------------------------------
~ Launch the Linux based VM
~ Connect to the Instance
~ Install Java Software:
	To install Java 11 on Amazon Linux:
	sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11

	To install Java 08 on Amazon Linux:
	sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
~ Check the Java Version:
	java -version

Installation of Tomcat Web Server in Linux based VM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~ Since the VM is Linux based OS, we will install the "tar" file of Apache Tomcat Web Server
		https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
~ Keep the cursor on tar.gz file and right click and select 'Copy link address'
~ To install the Webserver: wget <Paste the tar.gz link> (Tar file of Apache Tomcat will get installed)
~ Extract the tar file
	tar -xvf <Name visibile in the red colour in the above link>
	ls -l (You can see the extracted file in blue color)
~ cd <Enter the name visible in blue colour in above line>
	ls -l (To see the folder structure)

Starting the Tomcat Sever
------------------------------------------
~ To start the server, we need to access the startup.sh file. This file is available in BIN Folder
~ cd bin/
~ To start the sever, 
	./startup.sh (You can see "Tomcat Started")

Accessing Tomcat Server
--------------------------------------
~ Copy the Public IP of EC2 Instance and paste in new tab ---- You will see the error page. This is because, the port no. 8080 is not enabled.

~ Enable Port No. 8080 in SGs of EC2 Instance.
	Type: Custom TCP, Port: 8080, Source: Anywhere

~ After enabling the port no 8080, go to new tab,
		<Paste the public IP of instance>:8080/ -----------You can see tomcat server page

Deploy the Web Application in Tomcat Server
---------------------------------------------------------------
The war file has to be deployed in the WEBAPPS Folder

Goto 02-Maven-WebApp-CivilEdu -----> Open Command Prompt in that path ----> Lets package the project -----> mvn clean package -----> You can see Build Success ----> You can see the war file in target folder

Since we are accessing the Tomcat in our PC, we can only access the HOME PAGE of TOMCAT. We cannot perform the Admin activities from our PC.
To perform the admin activities from our PC, we need to edit the "context.xml" and configure "tomcat-user.xml" files.

Editing the context.xml to give the Admin permissions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File path of context.xml:
	cd tomcat/webapss/manager/META-INF/context.xml

vi context.xml ----> Edit the allow tag -----> ".*" />

Configuring the Users in Tomcat
---------------------------------------------
we need to edit the tomcat-users.xml to configure the users. 
The "tomcat-users.xml" file is available in "conf" folder

<role rolename="manager-gui" />
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui" />
<role rolename="admin-gui" />  
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>

Click on 'Server Status' in the Tomcat Browser ----> Enter the username (admin) and password (admin)

Deploying the "war" file of our application
------------------------------------------------------------
Scroll down to see "War file to deploy" -----> Click on Choose File ----> Select the war file from our PC ----> Click on "Deploy" 
You can see our application under "List Applications"

This is all about the Manual Deployment, which is a troublesome process and time taking. Human errors is also a possible case.

To avoid this, we need to do the automation of deployment.

To do the automation of deployment of an application we will use JENKINS


Installation of Jenkins on EC2 Instance:
----------------------------------------------------------
***********
Part 1
***********
1. Launch and Connect to the Instance using MobaXTerm
2. Become Root User
sudo su
cd (You will see only IP of Instance)
sudo yum update -y
***********
Part 2
***********
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/tutorial-for-installing-jenkins-on-AWS/
3. Add Jenkins repo. to our YUM repo:
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo

4. Import a key-file from Jenkins-CI to enable the installation from package:
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade
***********
Part 3
***********
5. Installing Java
sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
java -version
6. Install Jenkins:
sudo yum install jenkins -y
7. Lets start, enable, and check the status of Jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
You should see 'Active & Running' in Green Colour, which means the Jenkins Service is successfully installed.

Note:
To remove jenkins: sudo yum remove jenkins
***********
Part 4
***********
By default, the Jenkins tool will run on Port No. 8080
Enable Port No. 8080 for the EC2 Instance inorder to access Jenkins Tool.
Check Instance ----> Security ----> Click on link below the Security Group ----> Add Rule ---->
Custom TCP, Port No. 8080 ----> Save Rules.
Access Jenkins:
<public ip>:8080
cat <Paste the red code visible while accessing jenkins in browser> and execute in
MobaXTerm
Copy the code visible in MobaXTerm and Paste in Notepad
8f39e64834e34e3ba2e6b0ef55695ea0
Paste the above code in Jenkins Browser under "Administrative Password"
Click on "Install Suggested Plugins"
Create First Admin User
Provide Username, Password, Full Name, and Email
Save and Continue
Copy the Jenkins URL and Paste in Notepad
http://3.135.249.138:8080/
Save and Finish
Start Using Jenkins
You will see Jenkins Console
From now, we are going to create the JENKINS Jobs
